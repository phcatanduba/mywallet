Go all the way - Charles Bukowski
<br>
“If you're going to try, go all the way. 
<br>
Otherwise, don't even start. 
<br>
This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind.
<br>
It could mean not eating for three or four days. 
<br>
It could mean freezing on a park bench. 
<br>
It could mean jail. 
<br>
It could mean derision. 
<br>
It could mean mockery--isolation.
<br>
Isolation is the gift. 
<br>
All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. 
<br>
And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. 
<br>
And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. 
<br>
If you're going to try, go all the way. 
<br>
There is no other feeling like that. 
<br>
You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. 
<br>
You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. 
<br>
It's the only good fight there is.”
